## Beginner Level Descriptions of members
This is first hackathon for both of us. We have prior coding experience but we hadn't participated in any hackathons yet because of our college and now job work. We had a lot of fun during this hackathon and learnt a lot of things!
   Backgrounds-
1. Khushi Kapoor - Graduated in Bachelor of Technology(Computer Science). 
2. Vansh Sethi - Graduated in Bachelor of Technology(Electrical Engineering).

## Inspiration
Considering the hackathon theme to be about content creators, we wanted to make use of AI to help content creators and ease some of their tasks.

## What it does
In this project, we have 3 use cases-
1. Transcripter - A tool to transcript YouTube videos and translate the transcripts to other languages.
2. ThumbnAIl - A tool to generate a thumbnail for your videos as per the given text prompt.
3. ContentBrain - A tool to help you generate content for your YouTube video.

## How we built it
1. Wix by Velo - For creating the website, we used Wix. Thanks to the templates and features offered by Wix, the designing of the website was a lot easier.
2. JavaScript - For the backend of the website. We used the developer mode of Wix to write JavaScript for each feature page.
3. AssemblyAI - For the transcription of audio to text.
4. T-one Youtube Converter - We used this API from the RapidAPI portal to convert YouTube url to audio url and use it with AssemblyAI.
5. OpenAI - We used this for translating transcripts to other languages, image generation and content creation features.

## Challenges we ran into
1. Using OpenAI with Javascript was a challenge, it took us a lot of time to figure out the requests and how to not get 401 errors as the openai npm module was giving these errors.
2. To complete the project in time.
3. This is our first hackathon so it was really nerve-wrecking for us. We wish to participate in more in the future!

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
1. To use our own tool to generate the content for this video. 
2. To complete it and make something useful.

## What we learned
1. OpenAI
2. Wix by Velo
3. AssemblyAPI
4. RapidAPI
5. Javascript

## What's next for CreAItivity
1. Adding more features like summarisation, breakdown into chapters, etc.

## PS
Added screenshots of the JS code for the website and also added the code in the github repo.
